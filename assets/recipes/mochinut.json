In a large bowl, sift together 1 cup minus 1 tablespoon of all-purpose flour, 1 tablespoon cornstarch, 3/4 cup\u00a0glutinous rice flour, 1 tsp baking powder, and 1/2 cup granulated sugar. Then set it aside.\n2. In a separate bowl, press 3.5 oz of silken tofu through a\u00a0fine-mesh sieve. Make sure to scrape the bottom of the mesh to ensure all the tofu is used up.\n3. Now add in 1 large egg and 2 tbsp of water. Using a whisk, mix just to combine.\n4. Now add the egg and tofu mixture to the flour mixture and combine using a spatula.\n5. Once the dough begins to take shape, you can begin working it together using your clean hands.\n6. Now form the dough into little balls about 7 grams each. You should get a total of about 64 tiny balls. You will want to use a\u00a0kitchen scale\u00a0for this step.\n7. Now cut 8 (5x5 inch) square pieces of\u00a0parchment paper\u00a0and begin forming donut shapes on top of each paper using 8 dough balls for each donut.\n8. Fill a\u00a0heavy-bottomed pot\u00a0with about 2 inches of corn or vegetable oil and heat it to 325-350 degrees Fahrenheit. It\u2019s best to use an\u00a0instant-read thermometer\u00a0to get the perfect oil temperature for donuts. Make sure the oil isn\u2019t too hot or it will burn the donuts and leave them raw in the center. Having too low of heat will overcook them and make them dry.\n9. Place the square piece of parchment paper and donut onto a large slotted spoon and gently slip it into the hot oil. Fry about 2 donuts into the pot at a time. You don\u2019t want to overcrowd the pot.\n10. After about a minute or so, use\u00a0tongs\u00a0to flip the mochi donut over. And with those same tongs, carefully peel off the parchment paper and discard. Once the donuts have browned on one side, flip them over and fry for another minute.\n11. Using a slotted spoon, carefully transfer the donuts to a plate lined with paper towels to absorb the extra oil.\n12. Strawberry glaze: Start by melting 4 oz of\u00a0white baking chips\u00a0in a microwave-safe bowl. Then add 1 drop of\u00a0pink food coloring\u00a0and 2 oz of fresh strawberries and blend them in using an emersion blender. You can make this in a regular blender too. Make sure your strawberries are not too cold or you can seize up your chocolate. If they are straight out of the fridge just heat them up in the microwave for about 10 seconds. \ufffc\ufffcNow dip the donuts into the glaze and transfer to a cooling rack to set.\n13. Matcha glaze: add 1/4 cup of hot simmered heavy cream to 4 ounces of white chocolate chips. Mix until smooth, then whisk in 1 tsp of\u00a0matcha powder. Mix again and dip a few donuts in the match glaze.\n3. Chocolate Nutella glaze: sift 3/4 cup powdered sugar and 2 tbsp\u00a0unsweetened cocoa powder\u00a0into a bowl. Then whisk in 3 tbsp warm milk, and 3 tbsp Nutella. Dip the donuts and let them set. I decorated my mochi donuts with some drizzles of melted white chocolate and a little bit of crushed\u00a0special k cereal. Enjoy immediately. \ufffc\n\n\ud83d\udc9aWEBSITE: https://simplyhomecooked.com/\n\ud83d\udc9cINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/simplyhomecooked/?hl=en\n\ud83d\udc99FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/DinaSimplyHomeCooked/\n\u2764\ufe0fPINTEREST: https://www.pinterest.com/Simpyhomecooked/\n\n\ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83d\udcbb\ud83c\udf73\ud83d\udcf8\ud83d\udcbb\ud83c\udf99\ud83d\udd2a\ud83c\udfac\u2935\ufe0f\ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83d\udcbb\nSHOP SIMPLY HOME COOK'S AMAZON AFFILIATE STORE HERE:\n https://www.amazon.com/shop/simplyhomecooked\n\nThis recipe contains affiliate links.\n\n#mochidonuts #donuts #simplyhomecooked","uploadDate":"2020-08-29T18:24:19+00:00","duration":"PT10M20S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AiqFkWcKqMk/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiqFkWcKqMk","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AiqFkWcKqMk?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["8","8 Donuts"],"prepTime":"PT30M","cookTime":"PT20M","totalTime":"PT50M","recipeIngredient":["1 cup all-purpose flour (minus 1 tablespoon) (130 g)","1 tablespoon corn starch (10g)","3/4 cup glutinous rice flour (87g)","1 tsp baking powder (4g)","1/2 cup granulated sugar (100g)","3.5 oz silken tofu","1 egg","2 tbsp water","4 oz White chocolate","1 drop pink food coloring (optional)","2 oz fresh strawberries","4 oz White chocolate","1/4 cup Heavy Cream (simmered)","1 tsp Matcha powder","3/4 cup powdered sugar","2 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder","3 tbsp milk","3 tbsp Nutella"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToSection","name":"Sift the dry ingredients","itemListElement":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"In a large bowl, sift together 1 cup minus 1 tablespoon of all-purpose flour, 1 tablespoon cornstarch, 3/4 cup glutinous rice flour, 1 tsp baking powder, and 1/2 cup granulated sugar.
